Task 7 — Vulnerability Scanning with Nikto
Objective

Use Nikto to perform an automated vulnerability scan against a web server, analyze the results, and document identified security issues along with recommended remediation steps.
What is Nikto?

Nikto is an open-source command-line web vulnerability scanner. It sends a large number of HTTP requests to a target web server and compares the responses against a database of thousands of known-dangerous files, outdated software versions, and common misconfigurations. It automates the first pass of web reconnaissance so that manual testing effort can focus on confirming and exploiting real issues, rather than manually checking thousands of known signatures by hand.
Why Vulnerability Scanning Matters

A web application can have dozens of small misconfigurations — missing headers, exposed directories, leftover version-control files — that are individually easy to overlook but collectively expand what an attacker can see and exploit. Automated scanning catches this "low-hanging fruit" quickly and consistently, freeing up manual testing time for deeper, logic-based vulnerabilities that no scanner can find on its own. In short: scanning establishes the attack surface before deciding where the actual risk lies.
Ethical Use Guidelines

This task was performed exclusively against a DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) instance running locally in an isolated Docker container on my own machine. No external, production, or third-party systems were scanned. Nikto generates a high volume of HTTP requests in a short time and is easily detectable; running it against systems without explicit permission may violate laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (US) or the Information Technology Act (India), even without any exploitation taking place.
Environment
Component 	Detail
Attacker/scanner machine 	Kali Linux
Target 	DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application), via Docker
Scan mode 	Localhost (http://localhost) — scanner and target on the same machine
Nikto version 	v2.6.0
Target host / port 	127.0.0.1 : 80
Installation

Nikto (pre-installed on Kali, verified with):

nikto -Version

DVWA target, set up via Docker:

sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa

Database initialized via http://localhost/setup.php → "Create / Reset Database", then logged in at http://localhost/login.php with the default credentials.

Target reachability confirmed before scanning:

curl -I http://localhost

Scans Performed
1. Basic Scan

nikto -h http://localhost

Ran Nikto's full default test suite against the DVWA instance on port 80, checking for missing security headers, directory indexing, exposed configuration/version-control files, and known admin/login paths.
2. Scan with Output Saved to File

nikto -h http://localhost -o nikto_scan_results.txt

Saved the raw scanner output to file as permanent evidence, independent of terminal scrollback. This file is the source for the findings table below.
3. SSL Check Scan

nikto -h https://localhost -ssl

Not applicable to this environment. The DVWA Docker container only serves plain HTTP on port 80; curl -I https://localhost returns a connection failure, confirming no HTTPS listener is present. The SSL-specific scan was therefore not run.
Findings & Risk Analysis

13 unique vulnerabilities/issues were identified. (The raw output file contains two back-to-back scan runs with duplicate results; findings below are deduplicated.)
# 	Finding 	Severity 	Why It's a Risk 	Recommended Fix
1 	Server banner discloses Apache/2.4.25 (Debian) 	Low–Medium 	Reveals the exact server software/version, letting an attacker check for known CVEs affecting that version without any scanning of their own 	Suppress version info via ServerTokens Prod and ServerSignature Off in the Apache config
2 	.git/HEAD, .git/config, .git/index exposed under /dvwa/.git/ 	High 	A publicly accessible .git folder lets an attacker reconstruct the full commit history and potentially recover secrets (DB passwords, API keys) that existed in earlier commits, even if later removed 	Block access to .git/ at the web server level (e.g. <DirectoryMatch "\.git"> deny-all); never deploy a .git folder into a production web root
3 	Directory indexing enabled on /dvwa/config/; config info may be exposed remotely 	High 	DVWA's config directory holds database connection settings; indexing means an attacker can browse and download config files directly without guessing filenames 	Disable directory indexing (Options -Indexes in Apache); move config files outside the web-accessible root where possible
4 	Directory indexing on /dvwa/database/, flagged as database directory 	Medium–High 	May expose SQL setup/seed files, revealing database schema or default data and aiding further attacks 	Disable directory indexing; restrict access to setup/database directories after initial provisioning
5 	Directory indexing on /dvwa/tests/ and /dvwa/docs/ 	Medium 	Reveals internal file/folder structure and possibly test scripts or documentation not meant for public viewing, aiding reconnaissance 	Disable directory indexing site-wide; remove or restrict non-essential directories in production builds
6 	Missing Content-Security-Policy header 	Medium 	Without CSP, the browser has no restriction on which scripts/resources can execute, making any XSS vulnerability far more damaging 	Implement a CSP header (e.g. default-src 'self') tuned to the app's actual resource needs
7 	Missing Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header 	Medium 	Without HSTS, users can be downgraded to plain HTTP by a man-in-the-middle, exposing traffic to interception 	Add Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains once served over HTTPS
8 	Missing X-Content-Type-Options header 	Medium 	Browsers may MIME-sniff content, potentially executing a file as a different type than intended (e.g. treating an upload as JS) 	Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
9 	Missing Referrer-Policy header 	Low–Medium 	Full URLs (which may contain sensitive query parameters) can leak to third-party sites via the Referer header 	Add a header such as Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
10 	Missing Permissions-Policy header 	Low 	Browser doesn't restrict which powerful features (camera, geolocation, etc.) the page can request; DVWA doesn't use these, so practical impact here is low 	Add a Permissions-Policy header restricting unused browser features
11 	X-Frame-Options deprecated notice 	Informational 	Not a vulnerability itself — Nikto is noting that CSP's frame-ancestors directive is the modern replacement for clickjacking protection 	Covered by the CSP fix above (#6) rather than treated separately
12 	.gitignore and .dockerignore files exposed 	Low 	Reveals project structure and naming conventions (what files/folders developers considered sensitive) — useful recon, not direct exposure 	Block dotfiles at the web server level, or exclude them from the deployed web root entirely
13 	/dvwa/login.php identified as admin login page 	Informational 	Expected for any authenticated app; useful only as a reconnaissance data point (confirms where to attempt brute-force/credential attacks) 	No fix needed — optionally rate-limit login attempts and enforce account lockout as general hardening
